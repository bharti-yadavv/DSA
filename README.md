# DSA Practice Solutions

Welcome to my repository of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice problems. This repo contains my solved DSA problems that I am working on to enhance my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## Purpose

This repository serves two main purposes:
1. **Practice**: To improve my understanding and application of various DSA concepts by solving problems regularly.
2. **Showcase**: To demonstrate my skills in solving DSA problems to potential employers or anyone interested in my coding journey.

## Structure

The repository is organized by different categories of DSA problems, such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, and more.
